# RayGen: A Vision-Language Masked Generative Transformer for Chest X-Ray Generation
A scarcity of high-quality, labeled datasets often hinders the development of accurate and reliable diagnostic models in medical imaging, particularly in chest X-ray analysis. Recognizing the importance of addressing these challenges, our research proposes RayGen, a novel model synthesizing chest X-ray images by integrating vision and language processing techniques. RayGen aims to mitigate data scarcity by generating synthetic, yet realistic, chest X-ray images.

We adopt a multimodal approach with two input forms being considered. Images are obtained as embeddings using a vector quantized Generative Adversarial Network or VQ-GAN. The text embeddings from CXR Bert facilitated by Biovil-T. Further, text is obtained from reports that correspond to each X-ray image.  Finally, they are sent through our transformer decoder layer to obtain our synthetic image.

Our model consists of several parts, some trained and others adapted from pre-trained models. The figure above provides a visual representation of the architecture. During training, the impression section of the radiology reports is inputted to the CXR Bert model. At a high level, a given CXR in the VQ-GAN encoder model was already pre-trained on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The image embeddings are randomly masked according to a cosine schedule, flattened into a sequence, and then passed through an embedding layer before being added to learnable positional embeddings. The impressions section of a corresponding radiology report is also encoded via a pre-trained CXR BERT model and projected to the hidden dimensionality of the transformer decoder. The transformer decoder takes the masked image embeddings sequence as queries and the report embeddings as the context through several stacked layers of attention to eventually output a reconstruction of the latent representation of the image.

## Model architectures used
- Image Encoder: VQ-GAN (pre-trained)

## Dataset
The MIMIC-CXR database is a large, publicly available dataset of chest radiographs paired with free-text radiology reports. It includes 377,110 images from 227,835 imaging studies of 65,379 patients treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Emergency Department between 2011-2016. In addition to image data, we extracted and utilized the interpretation section of the radiology reports associated with each X-ray image.
